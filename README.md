## The world's ~~best~~ worst URL shortener

Yup, it's a URL shortener. I hacked this together just as a learning exercise and to see how quickly I could make this. About an hour or two, and that's without ever really using Flask or Peewee before.

This isn't running in the wild. I wouldn't if I were you. It's probably horribly insecure and certainly is ripe for abuse. Notably the ability to predict keys. But I think it's more fun that way.

### Why??

Well, some friends and I had some discussions about URL shorteners and how to create the key (the 'bobdole' in 'http://tinyurl.com/bobdole'). I had a few beers in me and got an itch to make a working implementation of my ideas.

### WTF does 'shrtnr' mean?

Shartner, I think. Or shortener. Definitely one of those two.
